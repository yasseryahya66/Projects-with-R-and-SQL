# R-data-analysis-projects

Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile! This repository documents my R learning journey and showcases my interest in data science.

I work on a variety of projects covering:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Data visualization

SQL queries

API usage and web scraping

Predictive modeling

The datasets I use for these projects come from Kaggle, Dataquest, and other open data portals. This repository serves as both a portfolio of my work and a record of my learning progress in R and data science.

Kind regards,
Yassir
